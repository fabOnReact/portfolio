	<p>Right now I'm living in Bali Kuta, I'm staying hear till the 11th of October. I work every day on my github projects in LinupHub. I surf in Kuta or Balangan once a day. Good life, but I want to go back to Europe

	<p>Right now I'm focusing on Testing with Rspec so for this reason I have done a fork and started <a href='https://github.com/fabriziobertoglio1987/railsmentor'>this project</a>, with which I will extensively use <strong>Rspec</strong></p>
